## Quick Start

To get started add very good workflows to an existing GitHub workflow:

```yaml
# A reusable workflow for Dart packages
uses: VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_workflows/.github/workflows/dart_package.yml@main

# A reusable workflow for Flutter packages
uses: VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_workflows/.github/workflows/flutter_package.yml@main
```

## Dart Package Workflow

### Steps

The Dart package workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Install Dependencies
2. Format
3. Analyze
4. Run tests
5. Check Code Coverage

### Inputs

#### `coverage_excludes`

**Optional** List of paths to exclude from the coverage report, separated by an empty space. Supports `globs` to describe file patterns.

**Default** `""`

#### `dart_sdk`

**Optional** Which Dart SDK version to use. It can be a version (e.g. `2.12.0`) or a channel (e.g. `stable`):

**Default** `"stable"`

#### `working_directory`

**Optional** The path to the root of the dart package.

**Default** `"."`

### Example Usage

```yaml
name: My Dart Workflow

on: pull_request

jobs:
  build:
    uses: VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_workflows/.github/workflows/dart_package.yml@main
